            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <div>
              <p>Pat's Salmon cookie was established on 1988 at Atlanta Georgia. Owner and founder Pat moved to Seattle from Georgia on 1995 and brought his home made recipies with him. <br>
                The first store in Seattle was established in Tacoma and Pat has been spreading the wonderful cookies around Washington ever since. This is a home owned business and we thank our customers for loving us and our cookies.
